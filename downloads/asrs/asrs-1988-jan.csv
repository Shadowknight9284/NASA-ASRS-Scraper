EVEN THOUGH NO MIDAIR OR VIOLATION TOOK PLACE; THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE DEVELOPED INTO AN INCIDENT.

I USED MY FAMILIARIZATION WITH THE AREA'S GND LIGHTING TO DETERMINE THAT WE WERE APCHING THE SMX-SBP AREA. ALSO; I DETERMINED THAT DUE TO OUR CLOSE PROX TO THE AREA THAT WE NEEDED TO START A DES RATHER QUICKLY. OTHERWISE; WE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET THE LTT'S DES LIMITATION OF A MAX 1000 FPM RATE OF DES AND STILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SPD TO THE ARPT. I ASKED ATC FOR A LOWER ALT AND WAS ASSIGNED TO 7000'. IN MY OPINION THIS ALT WAS STILL TOO HIGH TO MEET THE LTT'S LIMITATION SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR THE ARPT IN ORDER TO BE ASSIGNED A VISUAL APCH AND UNRESTRICTED LOWER ALT. WHEN APCHING THE SMX-SBP AREA FROM THE S; SBP IS THE LAST CLUSTER OF LIGHTS SIGHTED BEFORE CONTINUING TO THE N. BOTH THE F/O AND I SIGHTED AN ARPT BEACON IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE LAST CLUSTER OF LIGHTS. WE BOTH ASSUMED THIS TO BE SBP SO I CALLED THE ARPT IN SIGHT TO ATC. (WE ACTUALLY COULD NOT SEE SBP BECAUSE OF REDUCED VIS. I ESTIMATE FLT VIS AT APPROX 20-25 MI. WE DID NOT REALIZE THIS AT THE TIME.) WE WERE APPROX 35-40 MI AWAY AT THE TIME OF THE CALL BUT ATC STILL ISSUED A VISUAL APCH W/O QUESTIONING AS TO WHETHER OR NOT WE REALLY HAD THE ARPT IN SIGHT. THE F/O THAT I WAS FLYING WITH WAS ONE THAT I CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE AVERAGE SO I WAS RELIANT ON HIM TO JUDGE DISTANCE; SPD; ETC; AND TO SET US UP FOR A NORMAL LEFT TFC PATTERN INTO THE ARPT. I FOCUSED MY ATTN ON CALLING AND COMPLETING THE DES CHK; CALLING FOR CURRENT WX; SETTING UP THE RADIOS FOR A LOC BACK UP AND LOOKING OUT FOR TFC AND THE TERRAIN. WE WERE APPROX 4000' AND ON A HIGH LEFT DOWNWIND WHEN I CALLED; 'ARPT IN SIGHT; LNDG ASSURED; CANCEL IFR;' TO ATC. ATC SIMPLY CANCELLED AND WISHED US; 'GOOD NIGHT.' BECAUSE OF THE EASE AT WHICH ATC CANCELLED WE WERE FURTHER LED TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE APCHING THE CORRECT DEST ARPT. AT THIS POINT SEVERAL CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE MADE AS TO WHY THE CTLR DID NOT QUESTION MY RADIO CALL: FROM OUR POS 30 MI SW AT 4000'THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I COULD HAVE SEEN SBP EVEN DURING DAYLIGHT UNLIMITED VIS AS THE ARPT IS SURROUNDED BY HILLY-MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN; 30 MI OUT AT 4000' IN NO WAY ASSURED US OF A SUCCESSFUL LNDG AT SBP; THE F/O HAD SLOWED THE ACFT DOWN TO OUR FINAL APCH SPD OF 120 KTS (UNUSUAL FOR THE LTT UNTIL SHORT FINAL DURING VFR OPERATIONS); AND WE WERE NO LONGER HDG TO SBP BUT DIRECTLY TO SMX. HOWEVER; THE CTLR CANCELLED W/O ANY HESITATION OR QUESTIONING. IN FACT; THE CTLR GAVE US AN AUDIBLE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS RELIEVED BECAUSE HE NO LONGER HAD TO DEAL WITH US. AT APPROX MID-FIELD LEFT DOWNWIND I STARTED MAKING POS RPTS ON THE CTAF AND TRIED TO IDENTIFY THE LOC. I COULD NOT RECEIVE THE IDENTIFIER AND ASSUMED THAT WE WERE IN THE NON-RECEIVING AREA OF THE LOC. BECAUSE OF THIS I COMMENTED TO THE F/O THAT THE LOC WOULD PROBABLY COME IN AFTER WE TURNED BASE LEG. BOTH CREW MEMBERS WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE HILLY-MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN SURROUNDING SBP. ACCORDINGLY; OUR ATTN FOCUSED ON THE GND LIGHTING AS THAT WAS ALL WE COULD SEE OF THE TERRAIN (IT WAS A VERY DARK NIGHT; NO MOON; NO HORIZON; ETC). BOTH CREW MEMBERS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT DOWNWIND AND BASE TO CONCENTRATE ON JUDGING DISTANCE FROM THESE LIGHTS AND LOOKING FOR TFC WITH THE F/O QUICKLY GLANCING AT THE RWY TO JUDGE HIS PATTERN WORK. AFTER TURNING ON TO FINAL I NOTICED THAT BOTH THE HSI (CAPT) AND THE OMNI-INDICATOR (F/O) STILL HAD NAV/FLAGS. I COMMENTED TO THE F/O THAT IT WAS STRANGE THAT THE LOC STILL HAD NOT COME IN. THE F/O GAVE NO RESPONSE AS I GAVE MY ATTN TO THE RADIOS AND AGAIN TRIED TO IDENTIFY THE LOC. I CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF A NAV RADIO FAILURE AND RECHECKED; RETUNED THE FREQ; ETC. I TOLD THE F/O THAT WE STILL HAD NAV/FLAGS AS I STARTED TO SCAN THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS. NO RESPONSE WAS GIVEN FROM THE F/O AS I NOTICED THAT WE WERE APPROX 400'. I STARTED CALLING OUT THE 500' CHK. ALSO; I BRIEFLY GLANCED OUTSIDE DURING THE CHK AND NOTICED THAT BOTH THE APCH LIGHTING SYS (ALS) AND VASI WERE NOT ON. I COMMENTEDABOUT THIS TO THE F/O BUT HE DID NOT RESPOND. FINALLY; THE F/O LOOKED OVER AND NOTICED THAT HE COULD NOT HEAR ME SPEAK. SOMEHOW; MY HOT-MIC SWITCH WAS CLICKED TO THE OFF POS (A COMMON COMPLAINT FROM SFAR 41 LTT CREWS!). THE F/O REACHED OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE OF MY CTL STICK AND TURNED THE SWITCH BACK ON AGAIN KEEPING MY ATTN TO THE INSIDE OF THE COCKPIT. AT APPROX 100' AND AFTER INITIALLY CALLING AIRSPD AND SINKRATE I STARTED LOOKING BACK OUTSIDE AND CONCENTRATING ON THE ARPT. I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE NORMAL VISUAL CLUES FOR SBP AS THE RWY APPEARED TO BE WIDER AND MUCH LONGER AND THE RAMP AREA WAS DARK AND NOT LIT UP AS THAT OF SBP'S. I TRIED LOOKING FOR OTHER CLUES BUT EVERYTHING WAS MOVING RATHER QUICKLY AND WAS HARD TO IDENTIFY. CONSEQUENTLY; I ASKED THE F/O IF THIS REALLY WAS SBP AS I FIGURED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOOKING OUT AT THE ARPT SINCE WE HAD TURNED FINAL. THE F/O RESPONDED WITH A SOMEWHAT UNDISCERNING; 'I HOPE SO.' AT THAT POINT I DECIDED THE ARPT WE WERE ABOUT TO LAND AT WAS APPARENTLY NOT THAT OF SBP AND CALLED FOR A GO AROUND. UNFORTUNATELY; THE WHEELS TOUCHED SIMULTANEOUSLY AS I MADE THE CALL FOR A GO AROUND. SINCE THE WHEELS HAD TOUCHED AND I KNEW THAT WE HAD ENOUGH RWY TO STOP I ABORTED THE GO AROUND AND ASSUMED CTL OF THE ACFT. DURING ROLLOUT MY SUSPICIONS WERE CONFIRMED AS WE BOTH RECOGNIZED THE ARPT AS SMX. (THE FACT THAT I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE ALS GUARANTEED US ENOUGH RWY TO LAND. ONLY 2 ARPTS IN THE SMX-SBP AREA HAVE THE ALS AND WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE LNDG ON THE SHORTEST OF THE TWO--SBP. THE OTHER ARPT IS SMX.)

THERE WAS A TRUCK AND MEN OFF THE LEFT RWY EDGE AT MID FIELD. NO ADVISORY WAS GIVEN BY TWR. THE F/O LISTENED TO ATIS AND MADE NO MENTION TO ME ABOUT MEN; EQUIPMENT OR FIELD LIGHTING.

COMPANY FLT FOLLOWING PROCS WERE USED. THE GND CTLR ADVISED ON TAXI OUT THAT THE RWY LIGHTS WERE OUT OF SVC FOR MAINT. AT THAT POINT IT DID NOT REGISTER THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE IN SERVICE FOR TKOF. AS I APCHED THE RWY THE SITUATION BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND. IT WAS VERY LIGHT WITH A GOOD MOON AND MY TAXI LIGHT; LNDG LIGHTS; RECOGNITION LIGHTS AND WING ICE LIGHTS ILLUMINATED SO MUCH THAT IT DID NOT SEEM LIKE NIGHT. THERE WERE PLENTY OF BLUE TXWY LIGHTS ALL DOWN THE RWY PLUS THE VASI LIGHTS AND I THINK THE APCH LIGHTS. THE RWY WAS CLEAR TO ME. I ASKED THE CTLR WHAT TIME WAS OFFICIAL SUNSET AND FOR SOME REASON MY MIND TOLD ME THAT I WAS OK FOR 1 HR AFTER SUNSET; WHICH I WAS WITHIN. EVERYTHING WAS SO CLEAR THAT IT MISLED MY THINKING. ALSO; ANOTHER COMPANY ACFT OPERATING UNDER THE SAME RULES DEPARTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS NEARING THE END OF MY 3RD DAY OF DUTY. THE PREVIOUS DAY'S DUTY WAS 13 HRS AND 53 MINS WITH REDUCED REST OF 8 HRS AND 45 MINS AND I HAD BEEN ON DUTY THIS DAY FOR 10 1/2 HRS WITH 4 HRS TO GO. I HAD ALREADY TOLD MY F/O THAT BECAUSE WE WERE TIRED THAT WE NEEDED TO BE CAUTIOUS AND WATCH EACH OTHER CLOSELY. I MADE THE TKOF. THE ACTUAL DARKNESS AFTER LEAVING THE GND AND ALL OF THE AIRFIELD LIGHTS AND MY OWN ACFT LIGHTS JOLTED ME INTO REALIZING THAT I HAD ACTUALLY MADE A TKOF AFTER DARK W/O RWY LIGHTING AS REQUIRED BY 135.229B (2). THE BOUNDARY OF THE RWY WAS CLRLY DEFINED BY THE VASI AND TXWY LIGHTS AND I MAY HAVE IN FACT BEEN LEGAL; BUT ANOTHER IMPORTANT FACT KEEPS BOTHERING ME. I WAS FLYING IN A TIRED STATE OF MIND. I WAS TOTALLY LEGAL BY FAA RULES GOVERNING PART 135 COMMUTER DUTY AND REST PERIODS. COMPANY SCHEDULES ROUTINELY REQUIRE LONG DUTY DAYS FOLLOWED BY REDUCED REST AND AGAIN FOLLOWED BY LONG DUTY DAYS. AT THE URGING OF THE RAA (REGL AIRLINE ASSOCIATION) THE RULES WERE RECENTLY CHANGED TO SEP CHARTER AND COMMUTER DUTY TIME RULES UNDER PART 135. WE FLY DEMANDING SCHEDULES WITH 8-12 LEGS PER DAY. WE FLY A FAST AIRPLANE WITH NO AUTOPLT AND MUST MAKE MANY QUICK TURN AROUNDS BTWN LEGS. IN MANY YRS OF MIL FLYING IN MUCH LARGER EQUIP I NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH A WORKLOAD. WHILE MY PHYSICAL ABILITY TO MANEUVER THE AIRPLANE DOES NOT SEEM AS EFFECTED; I FIND MY DECISION MAKING ABILITY SUFFERS GREATLY AT THE END OF AN EXHAUSTING DAY. BEING AWARE OF THIS CERTAINLY HELPS AND THIS INCIDENT WILL SLOW ME DOWN EVEN MORE AND BE ANOTHER VALUABLE LESSON. I THINK THE CREW AND DUTY TIME REGS ARE THE REAL CULPRITS IN THIS INCIDENT. AS SOON AS I BROKE GND AND MADE MYSELF EVALUATE THE SITUATION I KNEW I WAS WRONG AND SHOULD HAVE RETURNED TO THE GATE. IN A MORE RESTED STATE; I WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS ON THE GND. INSTEAD; I SUBCONSCIOUSLY RATIONALIZED THE SITUATION AS SAFE (WHICH IT WAS) EVEN THOUGH IT BROKE A RULE. I RECOGNIZE THAT RULES ARE THERE TO MAKE DECISIONS LIKE THIS CUT AND DRIED AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALWAYS INSURING SAFETY. ON THE OTHER HAND; A RULE THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ROUTINELY SCHEDULE PLTS INTO FATIGUE HAS TO CREATE SOME CONTEMPT FOR THOSE SAME RULES. JUST BECAUSE THE ACFT ARE SMALLER UNDER 135 DOES NOT INDICATE A SMALLER WORKLOAD THAN UNDER 121. THE WHOLE DUTY TIME SITUATION OF PART 135 COMMUTER OPERATION SHOULD BE RE-EVALUATED AND NO COMPARISON SHOULD BE MADE TO PART 121. THESE ARE TOTALLY SEPARATE ENVIRONMENTS. THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC WE TRANSPORT SHOULD BE THE ONLY PREREQUISITE IN DEVELOPING SAFER RULES.

THE FLT STARTED OUT NORMALLY BUT FOR ONE EXCEPTION; THE CENTER TANK 2 FUEL GAUGE WAS INOP. THIS WAS OK'D BY THE MEL; HOWEVER; WE WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP A FUEL LOG TO KEEP TRACK OF THE FUEL BURN UNTIL TANK 2 EQUALLED TANKS 1 AND 3. IN ADDITION A KNOWN QUANTITY OF FUEL WAS TO BE PUMPED INTO TANK 2. THE FUELER BROUGHT OUR FUEL SLIP ON BOARD AFTER FUELING US. THE FUEL SLIP INDICATED 11900# OF FUEL IN TANK 1; 22200# IN TANK 2; 11900# IN TANK 3 AND 4000# IN THE AUX TANK FOR A TOTAL OF 50000 LBS. I VERIFIED THIS WITH OUR FUEL GAUGES ON BOARD; 11900# TANK #1; 11830# TANK #3; 4080# IN AUX TANK AND '22200 THE KNOWN QUANTITY' IN TANK #2 FOR A TOTAL OF 50010 LBS. WE THEREFORE ASSUMED THAT WE HAD OUR REQUIRED FUEL. SHORTLY AFTER THE FUELER LEFT; A MECHANIC CAME ON BOARD TO LOOK AT THE FUEL SLIP AND QUESTIONED IF WE WERE FUELED PROPERLY. I SHOWED HIM THE SLIP AND TOLD HIM WE HAD 22200#. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE WOULD GO CHK THE FUEL AND I VERIFIED THIS BY ASKING HIM TO DO SO. BEFORE OUR PUSHBACK; I REMINDED THE CAPT TO ASK THE PUSHBACK CREW ABOUT THE MECHANIC WHO WAS CHKING THE FUEL; THEY SAID ALL WAS OK. SO; WE THEREFORE COMMENCED OUR PUSH AFTER RECEIVING CLRNC FROM GND CTL. (WE WERE CONVINCED THAT WE HAD 50000 LBS OF FUEL ON BOARD.) AFTER A SHORT TAXI TO 24L WE TOOK OFF WITH; ACCORDING TO THE FUEL LOG; 49500# OF FUEL WHICH WOULD GET US TO PIT WITH 12900# LEFT. AFTER AN HR OF FLT I NOTICED 3 BOOST PUMP LIGHTS ON IN TANK 2 INDICATING A POSSIBLE MALFUNCTION. AFTER A FEW CHKS THAT WE MADE WE CALLED TO TALK TO OUR TECH CENTER TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP US SOLVE THE PROB. AFTER SEVERAL MORE CHKS THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE FUEL TANK MAY BE LOW ON FUEL. WE DECIDED TO DIVERT TO DEN TO GET THE PROB SOLVED (WE STILL WEREN'T FULLY CONVINCED THAT IT WAS A FUEL PROB). WE ARRIVED IN DEN. AFTER CLOSER INSPECTION ON THE GND WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT WE WERE MISFUELED IN LAX. IT IS APPARENT NOW THAT THE FUELER FAILED TO CONVERT PROPERLY GALLONS TO LBS AND THIS; COUPLED WITH AN INOP FUEL GAUGE (A BAD SCENARIO); CAUSED US TO BE MISFUELED.",,,,"ACR LGT DIVERTED TO ALTERNATE BECAUSE THEY DEPARTED LAX WITH INCORRECT FUEL LOAD.

JUST BEFORE WE LEVELED AT 1700' THE CTLR SAID TO US; 'CHK YOUR ALT.' CAPT SAID LEVELING 1700' AND I READ BACK 1700'. CTLR SAID; '1700' ALT WAS FOR ANOTHER ACFT; BUT YOU CAN STAY AT 1700'.' TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN; ANYTIME I HAVE ANY DOUBT ABOUT A CLRNC I WILL USE THE WORD CONFIRM IN MY READBACK TO INCREASE THE CTLR'S ATTN TO MY READBACK. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM ACN 80109: PASSING 5000' I THOUGHT I HEARD; 'COMPANY XAY; DES TO 1700.' I READ BACK; 'COMPANY XAY DSNDING TO 1700'; LEAVING 5000'.' AS WE APCHED 4000' THE CTLR SAID; 'COMPANY XAY SLOW TO 170 KTS AT 4000'.' I REPLIED; 'ROGER; SLOW TO 170 KTS AT 4000'; DSNDING TO 1700'; COMPANY XAY.' NO RESPONSE WAS HEARD. AT ABOUT 2400'; THE CTLR SAID; 'COMPANY XAY; CHK ALT.' I REPLIED; 'LEAVING 3 FOR 1700'; I PREVIOUSLY READ BACK MY CLRNC TO 1700'.' THE CTLR RESPONDED; 'ROGER; DES NOW TO 1700'; THAT CLRNC WAS FOR ACR B XBY.' THE COPLT; WHO WAS FLYING THE LGT; TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS SOME QUESTION IN HIS MIND ABOUT THE CLRNC; BUT ALL DOUBT WAS REMOVED WHEN I READ BACK THE CLRNC A SECOND TIME.

THE CTLR WAS CONSTANTLY BUSY; AND I WAS LISTENING UP. I WAS VERY SURPRISED THEN; WHEN I HEARD HIM CALL AND ASK IF I WAS ON FREQ. HE THEN SAID THAT HE HAD TERMINATED SVC 5 MI BACK AND ASKED IF I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE LAX TCA. I RESPONDED THAT I HAD NOT HEARD NOR ACKNOWLEDGED SUCH A CALL (I WAS STILL SQUAWKING 5204); AND GOT VERY CONCERNED AND FLUSTERED; AND BLUBBERED SOMETHING ABOUT NOT BEING VERY FAMILIAR. HE THEN SAID; 'WELL; IT'S NO PROB;' AND GAVE ME A VECTOR OF 110 DEGS. AFTER A COUPLE OF MINS HE GAVE ANOTHER CLRNC TO PROCEED ON COURSE AND SQUAWK 1200 AND ANOTHER FREQ FOR FURTHER RADAR SVC.

I DEEPLY REGRET THIS; AND BELIEVE I AND THE CTLR SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LANGUAGE AWARE. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CERTAIN OF CLRNCS; AND HE PERHAPS; MORE CERTAIN HIS INSTRUCTIONS ELICIT APPROPRIATE RESPONSE.

ACCORDING TO A RECENT LECTURE BY AN FAA REP AT MCAS EL TORO DURING A WING SAFETY STAND DOWN; COAST TRACON HAS ABOUT 50% OF THE CTLRS REQUIRED. THIS CTLR WAS BUSY! ADD A FEW EQUIP PROBS TO A SYS ALREADY OVERLOADED AND THE PROBABILITY OF HAZARD DETECTION AND ELIMINATION DROPS TO ZERO. OBVIOUS FIX? MORE PEOPLE; MORE SCOPES; BETTER EQUIP; AND ALL IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE WERE GIVEN A DES FROM FL240 TO 12000' ABOUT 25 MI E OF OCN; AND WHEN 10 MI E AT 12000' WE WERE TOLD BY CENTER TO SWITCH TO COAST APCH ON 380.2. I CHKED IN WITH INFO FOXTROT AT 12000'; ALTIMETER SETTING WAS 30.09. THE CTLR THANKED US FOR FOXTROT AND ASKED OUR INTENTIONS. I REPLIED THAT WE WANTED A PAR TO A FULL STOP. WE WERE THEN TOLD TO DEPART OCN HDG 260 DEGS AND DES TO 10000'. I ROGERED AND BEGAN OUR DES TO 10000'. THE CTLR SEEMED TO BE QUITE BUSY AND A HURRIED CALL WAS GIVEN TO DES TO 9000' AND SWITCH 337.2 (FREQ POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN 363.8). THERE WAS A LOT OF CHATTER ON THE RADIOS AND I BELIEVE ICS MAY HAVE BLOCKED PART OF THE CTLR'S REQUEST FOR A SPD REDUCTION. I HAD BEEN DOING ABOUT 330 KIAS IN THE DES; BUT SLOWED TO 250 KIAS AT 10000'; SO I ASSUMED THAT WAS WHAT HE WANTED; ALTHOUGH I WASN'T TOO SURE IF HE WAS TALKING TO ME BECAUSE THERE WAS A TAC CALL SIGN 2 ACFT BEHIND ME AND THE CALLSIGNS WERE BEING CUT OUT A BIT BY THE INITIAL MIC CLICK. ALSO; THE CTLR'S RADIO WAS COMING IN A BIT BROKEN; WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BECAUSE HE HAD TO ASK THE TAC CALL SIGN 2 ACFT SOMETHING TWICE BECAUSE OF THE POOR XMISSION QUALITY. WHEN I CHKED IN ON FREQ AT 9000' THE CTLR SAID I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT 10000'. BECAUSE HE WAS STILL COMING IN BROKEN I TOLD HIM THAT AND ASKED WHAT ALT DID HE WANT ME AT; '9000 OR 10000'?' HE SAID TO MAINTAIN 9000'. DURING THIS EVOLUTION I SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN AIR CARRIER AT MY 1 O'CLOCK; NOSE ON; AND MAYBE 4 OR 5 MI AWAY AT ABOUT THE SAME ALT; WITH WHAT APPEARED TO BE HIS LNDG LIGHT ON. THERE WASN'T A TFC CALL; BUT I THOUGHT LATER THAT PERHAPS THE CTLR WAS TRYING TO USE ALT TO SEPARATE US. A TURN TO HDG 250 WAS GIVEN TO ME AND COMPLIED WITH; ALTHOUGH THE TFC DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE A FACTOR TO ME. THE CTLR DID THANK SOMEONE ON VHF THOUGH; SO I WASN'T TOO SURE OF WHAT THEIR PERCEPTION WAS AT THE TIME. THE CTLR SOUNDED EXTREMELY BUSY; AND A QUICK CALL TO DES TO 7000'; THEN 4000' AND A TURN TO 330 DEGS FOLLOWED. HE CALLED ME TAC CALL SIGN 2 ALSO; ADDING TO THE CONFUSION; AND I THINK I HEARD THE OTHER ACFT RESPOND WITH SOMETHING. HE THEN ASKED ME TWICE TO CONFIRM THAT I WAS TAC CALL SIGN 1 ON 337.2; WHICH I DID BOTH TIMES. I WAS HANDED OFF TO A FINAL CTLR; WHO INITIALLY ALSO CALLED ME TAC CALL SIGN 2. AN UNEVENTFUL PAR FOLLOWED; ALTHOUGH THERE WERE 2 TFC CALLS NEAR THE COASTLINE AT 1 O'CLOCK; AND I SPOTTED ANOTHER ACFT AT ABOUT OUR 10 O'CLOCK. I MENTIONED TO THE RADAR OFFICER ON ICS THAT IT WAS LIKE THREADING THE NEEDLE OUT HERE TONIGHT. BECAUSE OF THE REQUEST TO CONFIRM MY CALL SIGN AND FREQ; THE CTLR'S OBVIOUSLY IRRITATED TONE OF VOICE; AND THE APPARENT CONFUSION ABOUT MY ASSIGNED ALT; I BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE MIGHT CONSIDER FLT VIOLATING ME; HENCE; I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS STATEMENT. THE RADAR OFFICER WAS NOT CERTAIN ABOUT THE 9000' DES REQUEST BECAUSE HE HAD MENTALLY TUNED OUT ALL THE FAST AND FURIOUS CHATTER; SO HE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT I MAKE THIS STATEMENT.",,,,"MIL FLT CREW TOOK CLRNC MEANT FOR ANOTHER MIL ACFT AND DESCENDED TO WRONG ALT.",

WE FILED CHEYENNE TO DEN; DIR AT 11000'; SCHEDULED TO DEPART AT 0A45Z. AFTER ENG START; WE WERE GIVEN A REVISED ROUTING; (V-19 TO WINIE INTXN; AND FROM THERE TO DEN; DIR) AND DEPARTED RWY 30 AT APPROX 0B10Z. THE FLT WAS UNEVENTFUL (IN AND OUT OF PATCHY IMC; CLOUD; BUT NO PRECIPITATION) UNTIL JUST N 5-10 MINS OF DEN; ON A HDG OF 171 DEGS; AT WHICH POINT WE HEARD A LOUD POP OR SNAP IN THE CABIN AND NOTICED A DUAL ALTERNATOR FAILURE INDICATION (2 RED LIGHTS) ON THE PANEL. WE DOWNLOADED ALL UNNECESSARY ELECTRICAL EQUIP; BUT WERE UNABLE TO BRING THE SYS BACK ON LINE. WE IMMEDIATELY ADVISED APCH OF OUR PROB. WE WERE THEN JUST N OF THE FINAL APCH COURSE FOR THE ILS 17L (WHICH WAS ALSO ACTIVE). WE WERE ADVISED TO EXPECT THE ILS DME 8R AND TO CONTINUE INBND. WE WERE THEN VECTORED; (FIRST SW 210 DEGS; THEN S 190 DEGS; THEN SE 100 DEGS) TO INTERCEPT THE ILS RWY 8R (078 DEG HDG) AND TOLD TO MAINTAIN 8000'. AS WE FLEW THE ASSIGNED VECTORS; AT ONE POINT APCH ASKED FOR CONFIRMATION THAT WE WERE AT 8000'; OUR ASSIGNED. WHEN WE CONFIRMED THAT WE WERE 'AT 8;' APCH ADVISED THAT WE WERE SHOWING A 2000' DISCREPANCY AND INSTRUCTED US TO STOP SQUAWKING OUR MODE C; WHICH WE IMMEDIATELY DID. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; WE WERE TURNED TO THE INTERCEPT (100 DEGS) COURSE FOR THE ILS (078 DEG); CLRD FOR THE ILS RWY 8R AND TOLD TO MAINTAIN 8000'; 'UNTIL ESTABLISHED.' AS WE BECAME ESTABLISHED; WE WERE ADVISED THAT WE WERE '4 MILES OUTSIDE THE MARKER; CLRD FOR THE ILS 8R; GO TO TWR; 118.3.' I CALLED TWR AND ADVISED OF OUR POS AND THAT WE HAD BEEN 'CLRD FOR THE ILS 8R.' RECEIVING NO RESPONSE; I CALLED AGAIN; THIS TIME TO ADVISE THAT WE WERE 'JUST OUTSIDE' THE MARKER AND 'CLRD FOR THE ILS.' AT THIS POINT; I HEARD TWR CALL: 'SMT; STAPLETON TWR; ARE YOU ON FREQ?' I RESPONDED THAT WE WERE 'ON FREQ;' AT THE MARKER; CLRD FOR THE ILS; 8R; AND HAD 'SMOKE IN THE CABIN;' WHICH I HAD BEGUN TO NOTICE. TWR AGAIN CALLED BACK: 'SMT; STAPLETON TWR; ARE YOU ON FREQ?' TWR THEN BECAME BROKEN UP; ADVISED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS 'CLRD TO LAND;' AND BECAME TOTALLY UNREADABLE; AND FINALLY FELL SILENT. DURING THIS APCH PHASE; I WENT THROUGH THE PRELNDG CHK; DROPPED THE FIRST NOTCH OF FLAPS; TURNED ON THE BOOST PUMPS AND DROPPED THE GEAR. WE HEARD THE GEAR MOTOR GO THROUGH WHAT SOUNDED LIKE ITS NORMAL CYCLE. I SAW THE GEAR TRANSITION LIGHT COME ON AND GO OFF AND THOUGHT THAT I SAW THE '3 GREENS.' DURING THIS SEQUENCE; HOWEVER; WE LOST ALL ELECTRICAL PWR. IN MY SCAN; I NOTICED ALL RED FLAGS ON THE ILS CDI AND GS; ALL RADIO AND PANEL LIGHTS WERE OUT. WE HAD ALREADY BEEN USING FLASHLIGHTS AND CONTINUED TO DO SO. THE SMOKE WAS BECOMING MORE NOTICEABLE. WE HAD NO FORWARD VIS. WE WERE STILL COMPLETELY IMC. IN A GLANCE OVER THE SIDE; THROUGH A SMALL HOLE; I SAW THE ARPT ENVIRONMENT BELOW. I DROPPED DOWN FURTHER AND BROKE OUT HIGH TO THE N OF THE FINAL APCH COURSE; AND VERY CLOSE TO THE TOUCHDOWN END OF 8R. I TURNED FOR THE RWY AND; ON SHORT FINAL; DROPPED THE LEVEL FOR THE SECOND NOTCH OF FLAPS. AS IT TURNED OUT; ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T THEN KNOW IT; THEY DID NOT COME DOWN ANY FURTHER. BY THEN THE SMOKE IN THE CABIN WAS GETTING THICKER. THE THOUGHT FLASHED THROUGH MY MIND TO CHK FOR GEAR EXTENSION MANUALLY AND I STARTED TO DO SO. THE PROC CALLS FOR A PULLING OF THE GEAR MOTOR CB AND A CRANKING OF THE GEAR HANDLE (WHICH IS STOWED BEHIND THE COPLT'S SEAT) 50 COMPLETE (360 DEG) COUNTER-CLOCKWISE TURNS. I KNEW THAT THERE SIMPLY WASN'T ENOUGH TIME TO DO IT. WITH NO NAV/COM OR OTHER ELECTRICAL PWR; WE COULD NOT STAY AIRBORNE ANY LONGER. WE COULD NOT CLB BACK INTO THE SOUP FOR ANY REASON. WE SIMPLY COULD NOT FLY AROUND THE STAPLETON ARPT ENVIRONMENT IN AND OUT OF A RAGGED CEILING AT NIGHT WITH NO NAV OR COM; WITH SMOKE IN THE COCKPIT AND WITH SIMULTANEOUS 17L AND 8R ILS APCHS IN PROGRESS; ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTEMPTING TO MANUALLY ASCERTAIN FULL GEAR EXTENSION. WE HAD TO LAND. AS WETOUCHED DOWN I FELT; FIRST; A STRANGE VIBRATION AND THEN A SICKENING FEELING AS I FELT THE GEAR COLLAPSE UNDER US AND WE BEGAN TO SKID DOWN THE RWY. AS WE FINALLY SKIDDED TO STOP; WHILE ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THE ACFT ON THE CENTER OF THE RWY (IT WAS SKIDDING TO THE RIGHT); I SHUT DOWN THE SWITCHES; FUEL AND MAGS; AND WE STARTED TO CLB OUT. WE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING THE DOOR OPEN AND; BY NOW; THE SMOKE WAS BILLOWING OUT FROM UNDER THE PANEL. JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP ON THE FRONT DOOR AND CLB OVER THE BACK SEAT TO TRY TO GET THE REAR DOOR OPEN; WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE FRONT DOOR OPEN; MY PAX'S SEATBELT OFF AND BOTH OF US OUT OF THE AIRPLANE. AS WE RAN CLR; I WAS CONCERNED THAT ACFT WHICH WE NOW COULD SEE ON FINAL BEHIND US WOULD NOT SEE US. I STARTED TO RUN BACK TO GET A FLASHLIGHT WITH WHICH TO SIGNAL; BUT REALIZED HOW FOOLISH AND FUTILE THAT WOULD BE. WE SIMPLY HOPED THAT THE ACFT WOULD SEE US AND GO AROUND. AS IT TURNED OUT; IT BROKE OFF ITS APCH AND FLEW A LOW PASS UP THE RWY OVERHEAD. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; WE WERE REACHED BY THE EMER CREWS. WE ARRANGED FOR THE ACFT'S REMOVAL AND STORAGE AND RPTED THE INCIDENT. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE ACFT WAS SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED; PERHAPS TOTALLY LOST. ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME THE CAUSE OF THE ELECTRICAL FAILURE IS UNKNOWN; I SUSPECT A SHORT IN THE ELECTRICAL SYS CAUSED BY THE ELECTRIC PROP DEICE. THE TIMER FOR THE PROP DEICE HAD BEEN REPLACED APPROX 3 WKS EARLIER AND HAD NOT BEEN USED IN FLT FOR ANY SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE NIGHT OF THE INCIDENT. THE CB FOR THIS SYS; WHICH WAS THEN IN USE; WAS TRIPPED (SWITCH OFF). THE TIMER IS LOCATED IN AN AREA UNDER THE PANEL FROM WHERE I THOUGHT I HEARD THE POP ORIGINATE. I BELIEVE THAT AN ALTERNATE BATTERY BUS SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIP IN ACFT OF THE TYPE IN QUESTION; AND THAT ALL ACFT FLYING IFR SHOULD HAVE A HAND-HELD PORTABLE NAV/COM RADIO ONBOARD AS STANDARD EQUIP.",,,,"DUAL ALTERNATOR FAILURE UNDER IFR CONDITIONS.

AS WE NEARED A POINT WHICH WE PERCEIVED TO BE RWY 4L WE REALIZED THAT ALMOST ALL VISUAL CUES WERE OBLITERATED BY SNOW. THE TXWY (PAINTED) MARKINGS AS WELL AS THE RWY 4L SIDELINE A MARKINGS WERE UNDER SNOW. IN ADDITION; THE MULTIPLE SIGN POSTS FOR RWY 4L WERE ALL ABOVE THE SNOW BANK; BUT THE SNOW REMOVAL EQUIP HAD PUSHED UP A DRIFT SO THAT THEY WERE UNRECOGNIZABLE. 5 MINS WITH A SHOVEL ON THESE SIGNS COULD HAVE CHANGED AN UNSAFE HOLD SHORT ENVIRONMENT TO A SAFE ONE.",,,,"HOLD SHORT SIGNS OBSCURED BY SNOW PILED UP DURING SNOW REMOVAL.",

WE HAD LEVELED OFF AT OUR ASSIGNED CRS ALT OF FL330. ON OUR AIRLINE THE PF MAKES ENRTE PAX ANNOUNCEMENTS. I TOLD THE CAPT I WAS GOING OFF AS I REACHED FOR THE P/A. I MADE MY ANNOUNCEMENT AND UPON COMPLETING IT; I FAILED TO TURN THE MONITOR SWITCH FOR THE PRIMARY RADIO BACK ON. I WAS ALSO FEELING QUITE RUSHED. I COMMUTE FROM A DISTANT CITY (2 TIME ZONES FROM DOMICILE) AND I DID NOT SLEEP WELL THE PREVIOUS EVENING. ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT MY DOMICILE; IT INVOLVED JET LAG PLUS WITHDRAWAL DUE TO ANOTHER FAMILY SEP. IN ADDITION; I WAS FROM A RECENTLY ACQUIRED AIRLINE (1 YR) AND THE CAPT WAS FROM THE ACQUIRING AIRLINE. ALTHOUGH WE ALL WEAR THE SAME UNIFORM; THERE IS A SEPARATE IDENTITY AND I WAS EAGER TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON MY FIRST LEG AT THE CTLS. FINALLY; THIS CAPT WAS VERY SHARP AND PROCEDURALLY CORRECT; THE ANTITHESIS OF THE CAPT I HAD FLOWN WITH JUST 2 DAYS BEFORE. AS A RESULT I WAS STILL ADJUSTING TO THE CHANGE FROM TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO BEING MORE PASSIVE. THE NET EFFECT WAS THAT THOSE THINGS THAT USUALLY CAME AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRED CONSCIOUS THOUGHT AND I HAD NO RHYTHM. OVER SGF I WAS AWARE THAT THE RADIO SEEMED AWFULLY QUIET. AT THAT POINT I NOTICED THE CAPT SPEAKING INTO HIS MIC AND I BECAME AWARE THAT MY RADIO MONITOR WAS OFF. THE CAPT TOLD ME TO DES TO FL290 AND I REPEATED THE CLRNC. AFTER ESTABLISHING A 1500 FPM DES I MADE A 5 MI ADJUSTMENT IN MY CALCULATED DES POINT. (THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE AT 1000'/2 1/2 MI RATIO; IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 10 MI ADJUSTMENT.) I LEVELED THE ACFT AT FL310 WHILE THE CAPT WAS ATTEMPTING TO REACH THE COMPANY TO CLARIFY THE STATUS OF THE ACFT UPON ARR. (WE WERE FLYING AN EQUIP SUBSTITUTION AND THERE WAS NO PUBLISHED DATA FOR EITHER THE COCKPIT OR CABIN CREW.) AS A RESULT OF THIS DISTR THE CAPT DID NOT NOTICE MY INCORRECT LEVEL OFF. APPROX 4 MINS LATER CENTER CALLED AND ASKED OUR ALT. I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE DISCREPANCY BTWN THE ALT ALERTER AND THE ALTIMETER. I REPLIED; 'DSNDING OUT OF 310 FOR 290.' THE CTLR WAS UNDERSTANDABLY UPSET AND ASKED; 'DID LEVEL OFF ON YOUR OWN? YOU'VE BEEN AT 3-1-0 FOR 50 MI?' I REPLIED; 'YES; IT WAS SORT OF A MISUNDERSTANDING.' THERE WAS NO FURTHER EXCHANGE. I AM AN AVID READER OF THE 'CALLBACK' AND THIS INCIDENT IS SO TYPICAL OF WHAT I HAVE READ IN YOUR PUBLICATION SO MANY TIMES BEFORE. THE UNCOMFORTABLE 'OUT OF SYNC' FEELING IS DEFINITELY AN INDICATOR OF TROUBLE. UNFORTUNATELY; THERE IS NO SYS OTHER THAN THE TRIED AND TRUE; IE; CHKLISTS AND ESTABLISHED PROCS; FOR RESOLVING THOSE FEELINGS IN A SAFE MANNER.

THE FE HANDED ME AN ACARS MESSAGE FROM DISPATCH ALERTING US TO TURBULENCE AND WIND SHEAR FOR LGA AND ALL THE NY AREA ARPTS. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO RELOAD THE PRINTER. ABOUT THIS TIME THE COPLT ACCEPTED A CENTER FREQ CHANGE AND RPTED LEAVING FL240 CLBING TO FL290. CLE CENTER ADVISED WE HAD 'XING 310 TFC HIGHER WHEN CLR.' NEXT CENTER SAID; 'TFC 11 O'CLOCK; 20 MI; WBOUND; 310.' COPLT ACKNOWLEDGED; '310 LGT.' APPARENTLY THAT IS WHEN HE SET 31000' IN OUR ALT ALERT. NEXT; CENTER CALLED ACR B STATING HIS TFC (US); '1 O'CLOCK; 20 MI; CLBING SE 26 CLBING 29.' REPLY WAS; 'ACR B.' THEN CENTER READ A LONG SIGMET ABOUT SEVERE TURBULENCE FROM GND UP TO 7000' AND WIND SHEAR OVER A LARGE AREA OF THE NE U.S. CLBING THROUGH ABOUT 29800' WE WATCHED THE TFC PASS OVERHEAD AT FL310. NEXT; COPLT RPTED; 'LEVELING 310 REQUESTING HIGHER.' CENTER IMMEDIATELY CLRD US TO FL330. A LITTLE LATER CENTER SAID WE HAD ONLY BEEN CLRD TO FL290; AND THEN CLRD US ON TO FL370. NEXT CALL WAS FOR BOS CENTER ON 133.95. PRIOR TO LISTENING TO THE TAPE; AT NO TIME DURING THE ENTIRE FLT DID I BELIEVE WE HAD DEVIATED FROM AN ASSIGNED ALT OR PASS LESS THAN 2000' VERT FROM THE THE OTHER ACFT. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN BY US UNTIL ARRIVING AT THE LAYOVER HOTEL. THERE; A MESSAGE FROM DISPATCH WAS WAITING FOR ME; TO CALL CLE CENTER ABOUT A POSSIBLE ALT VIOLATION. SOME POSSIBLE AREAS TO CONSIDER TOWARDS IMPROVING SAFETY: 1) SIMPLIFY ROUTING AND NUMBER OF MAPS NEEDED BTWN YYZ AND LGA. 2)PROPER RADIO TERMINOLOGY BY COPLT. 3) EXTRA ALERT IN MONITORING OF RADIO WHEN 1 MEMBER IS NOT ABLE TO LISTEN TO FREQ. 4) A BETTER WAY OF ALERTING AN ACFT WHEN IT ENTERS THE BUFFER ZONE AROUND ANOTHER ACFT. WE WERE NEVER ALERTED ABOUT OUR GOING THROUGH OUR ALT UNTIL WE HAD ACTUALLY PASSED THE TFC. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM ACN 80431: IN THE CLB FROM FL270 TO FL310 I HEARD THE CLE CENTER THEN CLR US TO CONTINUE CLB TO FL310. DURING ENTIRE TIME I HAD THE TFC IN SIGHT. PASSING FL298 I SAW TFC PASS OFF TO OUR RIGHT SIDE AT APPROX 1/2 MI. AT THAT TIME I CALLED CLE CENTER AND RPTED OUT OF FL300 FOR FL310 AND HE INFORMED ME THAT WE HAD ONLY BEEN CLRD TO FL290 BECAUSE OF THE TFC THAT PASSED US TO THE RIGHT. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN CLRD TO FL310 AND SET 310 IN THE ALT ALERT. EVERYONE ON THE FLT DECK ALSO THOUGHT WE WERE CLRD TO FL310. MAYBE A LONG CREW DUTY DAY (13 HRS) AND OVERANTICIPATION TO GET TO CRS ALT CAUSED ME TO HEAR AN ALT GIVEN IN AN INFORMATIVE MANNER AND I TOOK IT AS A CLRNC TO CLB.

I WAS ON THE LEG FROM BLYTH TO IMPERIAL AND WAS STEERING A COURSE OF 260 DEGS MAGNETIC AND ONE OF MY CHKPOINTS; THE HOLTVILLE ARPT; WAS ON MY STARBOARD BEAM. THE TOWN OF HOLTVILLE; ANOTHER OF MY CHKPOINTS; APPEARED BEFORE ME AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. AT THE SAME TIME; I BELIEVED I SAW THE IMPERIAL ARPT FARTHER IN FRONT OF ME. AT THIS POINT; I CALLED NAF EL CENTRO ON 126.20 AND INFORMED THEM OF MY INTENTIONS TO ENTER THE AIRSPACE SURROUNDING IMPERIAL AND NAF EL CENTRO FOR LNDG AT IMPERIAL; TO WHICH THEY REPLIED; 'ROGER; SMA.' I WAS SQUAWKING 1200 AND DON'T RECALL AN ATC CHANGE IN SQUAWK CODE. AT THE TOWN OF HOLTVILLE; I AGAIN CALLED NAF EL CENTRO AND REQUESTED A FREQ CHANGE TO IMPERIAL CTAF. I AGAIN RECEIVED A REPLY OF; 'ROGER; SMA.' I THEN CALLED IMPERIAL FOR ARPT ADVISORIES AND WAS TOLD; AMONG OTHER THINGS; RWY 14 WAS IN USE. I NOTED ON MY ARPT APCH INFO (PLT'S GUIDE TO CA ARPTS; PUBLICATIONS/86 REV) THAT THE DIAGRAM INDICATED RWYS 32 AND 14; WHICH THE TEXT INDICATED 'RIGHT TFC RWY 24.' IN TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS CONFLICT; I EVIDENTLY BECAME PREOCCUPIED WITH ITS RESOLUTION. INASMUCH AS I WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE IT IMMEDIATELY; I CALLED THE FLT SVC STATION AT IMPERIAL ONCE AGAIN TO INQUIRE. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PROPER RWY WAS 14L. BY THIS TIME; I HAD APPARENTLY OVERFLOWN IMPERIAL AND BECAME FIXED ON THE RWY AT NAF EL CENTRO. WHEN I WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO NAF EL CENTRO TO DISTINGUISH THE NUMBER '26' PAINTED ON THE RWY; I REALIZED THAT THIS INFO WAS INCONSISTENT WITH ANY OF THE NUMBERS AT IMPERIAL. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE IMPERIAL FLT SVC STATION AGAIN; ASKING IF IMPERIAL HAD A RWY 26. I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY DID NOT AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT NAVAL AIR TFC CTL ON A FREQ THAT I CANNOT REMEMBER. I CONTACTED THIS FREQ IMMEDIATELY; INFORMED THEM OF MY PREDICAMENT; AND ASKED THEM TO 'GET ME OUT OF HERE.' I WAS IMMEDIATELY GIVEN VECTORS TO THE IMPERIAL FIELD; WHICH LAY APPROX 180 DEGS FROM MY POS. I INQUIRED OF THE ATC OPERATOR IF I HAD CREATED ANY DIFFICULTIES AND WAS INFORMED THAT I HAD NOT. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD; I MADE A ROUTINE APCH AND LNDG AT IMPERIAL. AFTER REFUELING; I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS A TELEPHONE CALL FOR ME.

PASSING OVER THE ETX VOR AT OR UNDER 2000' MSL; I TOOK A HDG OF 234 DEGS AND ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT READING APCH TO LAND FOR A CUP OF COFFEE. READING APCH HAD DIFFICULTY HEARING MY COMS; SO I INITIATED A CRS CLB TO OBTAIN BETTER RECEPTION/XMISSION AT ABOUT 2500' MSL. I WAS THEN ASSIGNED A DISCRETE SQUAWK AND PROCEEDED TO LAND AT RDG. UPON LNDG THE TWR INFORMED ME TO CALL ABE APCH ON THE LANDLINE. THIS I IMMEDIATELY DID. THE SUPVR AT ABE APCH INFORMED ME THAT I WAS IN THEIR ARSA; AND ASKED IF I SAW LGT X. I SAID THAT I DID SEE THE AIRLINER AND THAT I DID NOT REALIZE I HAD ENTERED AND TRANSITED THE ARSA; BELIEVING I WAS W OF IT. HE THEN INFORMED ME THAT HE STOPPED THE DES (DELAYED) UNTIL IT PASSED OVER ME. UPON LNDG RDG I OBTAINED A DISCRETE CODE WHEN AIRBORNE SO THAT I COULD PROPERLY TRANSIT ABE ARSA ON MY RETURN FLT TO N52; AS MY FLT PATH WOULD TAKE ME JUST S OF THE ABE ARSA. I BELIEVE THE SITUATION OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING: 1) I WAS FLYING VFR FOR PLEASURE WITH NO SPECIFIC DEST IN MIND UNTIL AIRBORNE FOR AWHILE. 2) I WAS UTILIZING NOAA ENRTE LOW ALT IFR CHARTS WHICH DO NOT OUTLINE ARSA'S AS THEY DO TCA'S. TO PREVENT RECURRENCE: NOAA ENRTE LOW ALT CHARTS SHOULD DEPICT ARSA'S. WHEN FLYING VFR I SHOULD HAVE APPROPRIATE SECTIONAL TO REFERENCE IN ADDITION TO NOAA CHARTS.

AS A RESULT WHEN HE REALIZED HIS ERROR IN NOT ARMING THE IGNITERS AND TURNING THEM ON; FUEL HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE TAIL PIPE WHICH IGNITED CAUSING THE FIRE TO SHOOT OUT THE TAIL OF THE ENG. AS SOON AS THE OTHER ACFT RPTED THE FIRE; THE CAPT SHUT OFF THE FUEL LEVER AND ADVISED THE F/O TO CONTINUE MOTORING THE ENG TO BLOW OUT THE EXCESS FUEL. NO EGT LIMITS WERE EXCEEDED AND AFTER INSPECTION BY THE FIRE CREW THE FLT DEPARTED.

UPON REACHING ABOUT 90 KTS; I NOTICED THE ACFT DRIFTING TO THE RIGHT OF CENTERLINE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS THE WIND. I WAS CORRECTING THE DRIFT WHEN V1 WAS ANNOUNCED AND I BEGAN ROTATION. IMMEDIATELY AFTER LIFTOFF; THE ACFT WANTED TO YAW AND ROLL TO THE RIGHT. I USED FULL LEFT AILERON AND RUDDER PRESSURE TO KEEP FROM ROLLING RIGHT AND CHKED ENG INSTRUMENTS AND CALLED FOR 'GEAR UP.' I CTLED THE ACFT TO ALMOST LEVEL WITH A SLIGHT YAW AND ROLL TO THE RIGHT. I WAS UNABLE TO TURN LEFT AS INSTRUCTED AND TOLD TWR WE WERE UNABLE TO TURN. I CTLED THE ACFT AND I ASKED THE F/O TO ADJUST THE AILERON TRIM TO THE LEFT. SHE PUT IN ALL LEFT AILERON TRIM AND SOME RUDDER TRIM. AS AIRSPD INCREASED I HAD A LITTLE BETTER CTL AND MADE RIGHT TFC AND RETURNED FOR AN UNEVENTFUL LNDG. I HAD SOME DIFFICULTY DURING APCH AND LNDG; BUT KEPT THE ACFT FAIRLY STRAIGHT AND STABLE. I TAXIED TO THE GATE AND DEPLANED THE PAX. MY THEORY OF WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE RUDDER TRIM WAS ALMOST FULL RIGHT PRIOR TO TKOF. THE ACFT HAD JUST COME OUT OF AN INSPECTION AND THE TRIM WAS LEFT AT FULL TRAVEL. DURING THE TAXI CHK; I WAS TAXIING AROUND THE RAMP WHEN THE CHK FOR TRIM WAS DONE. I LOOKED AND ADJUSTED THE RUDDER TRIM TO SEE THE MARK ON THE WHEEL AND DID NOT PUT MY ATTN TO THE UPPER WHEEL WITH A NOTCH WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE MATCHED TO THE BLACK MARK. I HAD NEVER HAD TO READJUST THE RUDDER TRIM MORE THAN A LITTLE BIT; BUT IN THIS CASE I MAY HAVE HAD TO TURN THE TRIM WHEEL MORE THAN 1 TURN TO CENTER IT. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR MAY BE THAT THIS TRIM WHEEL WAS DIRTY AS WAS THE CENTERING INDICATOR NOTCH; THUS MAKING IT HARD TO DISTINGUISH A TRUE CENTER POS. I CANNOT ACTUALLY CONFIRM THAT THE RUDDER TRIM WAS IMPROPERLY SET BECAUSE AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS AN AILERON PROB AND WENT OUT AND CHKED THEM. I THEN WENT INSIDE TO CALL MAINT. WHEN I CAME OUT MY F/O HAD MOVED ALL THE CTLS AND TRIM WHEELS TO CHK FOR TRAVEL; SO I DIDN'T HAVE THEIR LAST POS. ALSO; DURING PREFLT MY F/O NOTICED THE RUDDER TRIM NOT LOOKING RIGHT.

THE PIC; BEING A DESIGNATED PPE FOR THE ACFT TYPE; WAS GIVING A BIENNIAL FLT CHK TO THE OTHER CAPT. THE PIC WAS OCCUPYING THE RIGHT SEAT AT THE TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE. AFTER A NORMAL TKOF AND AREA DEP THE ACFT WAS CLBING TO AN ATC CLRNC ALT OF 14000'. THE PF WAS USING THE AUTOPLT AND DURING THE LAST 1000' OF CLB HE WAS USING THE PITCH CTL OF THE AUTOPLT TO REDUCE THE RATE OF CLB FOR A SMOOTH LEVEL OFF. AT APPROX 13800' THE AUTOPLT ALT PRESELECT MODE WENT FROM AN AMBER ARMED INDICATION TO A GREEN CAPTIVE ANNUNCIATION. THIS OCCURS AT 20% OF THE VERT SPD RATE AT WHICH THE ACFT IS CLBING. WE WERE CLBING AT 1000 FPM THUS THE AUTOPLT WAS CORRECT IN ITS OPERATION. HOWEVER; IF THE PLT INPUTS A PITCH TRIM COMMAND TO THE AUTOPLT WHEN IT IS BEGINNING THE ALT CAPTURE; IN THIS CASE 13800' TO 14000'; THIS WILL DISENGAGE THE ALT CAPTURE FEATURE OF THE AUTOPLT. TO CONTINUE; THE PNF PIC NOTICED THE CAPTURE LIGHT EXTINGUISH AT APPROX 13800' AND STATED; 'NO ALT CAPTURE; GO MANUAL.' THE PF THEN DISENGAGED THE AUTOPLT AND PROCEEDED TO LEVEL THE ACFT MANUALLY. IN THE PROCESS THE ACFT DRIFTED TO AN ALT OF 14200'. THE PNF PIC STATED; 'GET IT DOWN; THERE'S TFC AT 15000'.' AT THAT TIME ATC ADVISED THAT THE COMPUTER SYS ALARM HAD TRIGGERED AND ASKED US TO CONFIRM OUR ALT. ATC FURTHER ADVISED THAT THEY INDICATED OUR ALT WAS 14500'. AT THE SAME TIME I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE 15000' TFC AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POS EBND. WHEN ATC ASKED OUR ALT WE WERE DSNDING FROM 14100' TO 14000'. IN DISCUSSING THE SITUATION WITH ATC THEY WERE STILL READING OUR ALT AS 14100' WHEN WE WERE IN FACT AT 13900' DUE TO THE SLIGHT OVER-CORRECTION TO RE-ESTABLISH THE 14000' ALT. LATER; IN CONVERSATION WITH THE NEXT ATC SECTOR; WE WERE ASKED OUR ALT AND WE WERE INDICATING 16000' IN LEVEL FLT. HOWEVER; THEIR RADAR READ 16300'. ANALYZING THE SITUATION IN RETROSPECT; WE COULD HAVE CTLED THE ACFT SO AS TO HAVE NOT EXCEEDED 14000' ALT; BUT WE HAD TO CONSIDER THE WELFARE OF THE PAX ALSO; AND A MORE ABRUPT MANEUVER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THEIR INTERESTS. ANOTHER FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION IS ALTIMETER BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SETTINGS. THE UNCONTROLLED ARPT FROM WHICH THE FLT DEPARTED HAD AN ALTIMETER SETTING OF 29.85 AND THE SETTING THAT ATC WAS GIVING WAS 30.04. THIS DIFFERENCE WOULD INDICATE THE ACFT TO BE 190' HIGHER ON THE RADAR READOUT THAN THE CREWS' INDICATIONS ON THE COCKPIT ALTIMETERS. THIS VARIATION; COUPLED WITH THE 200' OVERSHOOT PLUS THE MODE C CALIBRATION FOR THIS SPECIFIC ACFT WOULD EQUAL 430' OF ALT. ALTHOUGH NOT PRIVILEGED TO THE ATC CALIBRATION ERROR; I WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME THEIR EQUIP TO BE IN THE AREA OF +50-+70'; THUS THE TOTAL WOULD EQUAL 500'; WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO TRIGGER THE WARNING SYS. A DEPT PLT MEETING WILL BE HELD TO DISCUSS THE HAPPENSTANCE AND TO CREATE AN AWARENESS OF THE VARYING FACTORS THAT CAN CREATE DIFFERENCES IN READOUTS AND THE NECESSITY FOR CLOSELY MONITORING AUTOPLT OPERATIONS.",,,,"CPR LTT HAS LESS THAN STANDARD SEPARATION WITH ANOTHER ACFT.",

THEY CARRIED THE EXAMINATION FURTHER BY PULLING THE INSPECTION PANEL ON THE UNDERNEATH SIDE OF THE WING DIRECTLY BELOW THE GND SPOILER #10. WHEN THE INSPECTION PANEL WAS REMOVED A STEEL SPOILER LOCKING BLOCK THAT IS USED BY MAINT TO SECURE THE SPOILER FELL TO THE GND. THIS LOCKING BLOCK HAD BEEN LEFT INSIDE THE WING FROM THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S MAINT CHK. I WAS SATISFIED WITH THE COMPLETION OF THIS CHKOUT. WE ALLOWED THE BRAKES TO COOL OFF THE PRESCRIBED AMOUNT OF TIME. THE ACFT WAS INSPECTED DUE TO THE OVERWT LNDG AND EVERYTHING WAS THEN SIGNED OFF IN THE ACFT LOGBOOK BY MAINT. A NORMAL FLT WAS THEN OPERATED FROM LAX TO PIT. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 80725: WHILE ADVANCING THROTTLES FOT TKOF; ROLLING; ACR X MLG SAID; 'YOUR SPOILERS ARE OUT.' WITH THE PWR SET AT 70 K I MENTIONED TO THE CAPT THAT ACR X SAID OUR SPOILERS WERE DEPLOYED. THE CAPT SAID IT WAS SOME OTHER ACFT. THE CAPT DID NOT USE HIS HEADSET AND WITH THE COCKPIT NOISE IT'S EASY TO MISUNDERSTAND THE RADIOS. SUPPLEMENTAL INFO FROM ACN 80891: WE ARRIVED AT OPERATIONS IN LA AT THE NORMAL CHK-IN TIME (1:00 PRIOR TO PUSHBACK). THE ACFT WAS SITTING AT THE GATE; HAVING COME FROM OVERNIGHT MAINT EXTERNAL PWR WAS PLUGGED IN AND ON THE ACFT BUS. BOTH B SYS HYD PUMPS WERE OFF AND THE GND INTERCONNECT WAS CLOSED. DURING THE PREFLT WALKAROUND; A SPOILER WAS FOUND IN AN UNSTOWED POS ON THE RIGHT WING. NO PARTICULAR NOTE WAS MADE OF THIS SINCE THE ACFT HAD COME FROM MAINT AND APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN HYDRAULICALLY UNPOWERED FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I WOULD SUGGEST STREAMERS ON ALL CTL LOCKS.",,,,"ACR LGT MADE A TKOF WITH A SPOILER UP. RETURN LAND.",

MAINT HAD INSPECTED AND SIGNED OFF THE ACFT AIRWORTHY FOR FURTHER SVC. F/O AND I INSPECTED THE ACFT WITH SPECIAL ATTN TO THE NOSE WHEEL AREA AND FORWARD FUSELAGE BEFORE FLT. WE FOUND DEER HAIRS AND SPLATTERINGS OF BLOOD INSIDE THE WHEEL WELL. THE LNDG LIGHT WAS INTACT; NO HYD LEAKS OR NO BENDING OF FORWARD AIRFRAME.

IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION I BELIEVE THE ACFT SHOWED NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE AT THIS TIME. I AM ALSO CONFIDENT THAT OUR CREWS; IF THERE HAD BEEN DAMAGE; WOULD NOT HAVE FLOWN SUCH AN ACFT; AND OUR CONSERVATIVE MAINT DEPT WOULD NOT HAVE DISPATCHED SUCH AN ACFT WITH DAMAGE. MY THEORY IS THE DEER STRIKE MAY HAVE WEAKENED IT AND ADDITIONAL LNDGS MAY HAVE EVENTUALLY SHOWED DAMAGE AFTER MANY LNDGS. I WAS DRAFTED TO FERRY THIS DAMAGED ACFT TO OKLAHOMA CITY UNDER FAA AND COMPANY SUPERVISION. IN LOOKING AT THE ACFT; IT WAS NOTICEABLE RIGHT AWAY THAT THE PLANE HAD BEEN DAMAGED AS WE DROVE UP AND INSPECTED IT. THIS DAMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN HARD TO MISS AFTER THE DEER STRIKE. THE ACFT SHOWED DAMAGE TO THE NOSE WHEEL AREA AND FORWARD FUSELAGE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: ACFT RETURNED TO THE MFG FOR REPAIRS. THEY ARE CONVINCED THE DAMAGE TO THE NOSE AREA HAD TO BE CAUSED BY A HARD LNDG. ESTIMATED COST OF REPAIRS; $19000. 9 PLTS HAD FLOWN THE ACFT AFTER THE DEER STRIKE AND NONE SAW DAMAGE AS INDICATED WHEN THE ACFT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SVC. DURING THE OPERATION OF THE ACFT MAINT HAD DECLARED THE ACFT AIRWORTHY BEFORE EACH OPERATION. AFTER FURTHER REVIEW THE FAA IS NOT TAKING ACTION AGAINST THESE PLTS.

I IMMEDIATELY GRABBED THE CTLS AND PULLED THE ACFT HARD RIGHT. MY COPLT NOW SEEING THE FGT'S; FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH ME.

A WX BRIEFING WAS OBTAINED ON THE MORNING OF X JAN; WHICH INDICATED WINDS AT 3000' AT 280 DEGS WITH RPTED VIS AT NASHVILLE OF 12 MI. IN PLOTTING THE COURSE; I HAD PROPOSED TO FLY DIR UNTIL I ARRIVED AT THE BOUNDARY OF THE NASHVILLE ARSA; AT WHICH TIME I HAD PLANNED TO FLY SLIGHTLY S AND COME INTO SMYRNA FROM THE S. THIS WOULD DIRECT ME CLR OF ANY INTERFERENCE WITH THE ARSA. ADDITIONALLY; I HAD PLANNED TO ARRIVE AT SMYRNA AT APPROX XX HRS TO AVOID ANY COMMUTER BUSINESS TFC WHICH MAY OCCUR IN THE EARLY HRS OF MORNING. I DEPARTED CARROLL COUNTY ARPT; MC KENZIE; TN. AFTER FLYING A SHORT DISTANCE; I ESTABLISHED THAT I HAD A GND SPD OF 115 MPH CREATING ARR WITHIN AN HR. ALL ALONG THE COURSE I SHOWED MYSELF APPROX 3 MI S OF MY PLANNED COURSE; WHICH I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH DUE TO IT ALLOWING ME AN ADDITIONAL BUFFER PREVENTING DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE ARSA. I ALSO HAD PLANNED THE EXACT POINT IN WHICH I WOULD BEGIN CONTACT WITH SMYRNA TWR OR UNICOM; WHICHEVER WAS IN SVC. ALL WAS GOING AS PLANNED; SO IT SEEMED; UP TO WHERE I MADE VISUAL CONTACT OF WHAT I THOUGHT TO BE SMYRNA ARPT. UPON ARRIVING AT MY POINT TO INITIATE CONTACT WITH SMYRNA; I BEGAN ATTEMPTING CONTACT WITH NO RESULTS. EFFORTS WERE CONTINUOUSLY MADE ON BOTH TWR AND UNICOM FREQ. MY ALT AT THIS TIME WAS APPROX 1700' MSL; A SAFE ALT SHOULD I PENETRATE THE OUTER SKIRTS OF THE ARSA. I CONTINUED MY PRE-PLANNED APCH FROM THE S. AS I WAS INBND FROM THE S; I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER SCANNING TO THE NNW IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THE NASHVILLE ARPT. HOWEVER; DUE TO THE SOMEWHAT HAZY VIS; I DETERMINED THAT I WOULD BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY IT CLEARLY. I BEGAN MY TERRAIN REFERENCING AND ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH GND REFERENCES TO VERIFY THAT I WAS AT SMYRNA. I NOTICED THE BODY OF WATER TO THE E; THE WATER TWR ADJACENT TO THE RWY AND THE ROW OF LARGE BLDGS LYING ON THE E SIDE OF THE RWY. ACCORDING TO THE FLT GUIDE RWY DIAGRAM WHICH I WAS REFERRING TO; ALL SEEMED IN ORDER. HOWEVER; I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH MY INABILITY TO MAKE RADIO CONTACT. AT ONE POINT; WHICH WAS MY FIRST MISTAKE; IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD HOLD SHORT AND ESTABLISH RADIO CONTACT WITH SOMEONE. HOWEVER; I WAS OVER-RIDDEN WITH ASSURANCE OF BEING ON COURSE DUE TO NO MAJOR ACTIVITY (AIR TFC) AT THE ARPT AND THE TERRAIN FEATURES MENTIONED EARLIER. ARRIVING CLOSER TO THE ARSA; STILL REPORTING MY POS AND ATTEMPTING TO GAIN RADIO CONTACT; I BEGAN AN EFFORT TO READ THE RWY NUMBERS. IT WAS THEN I BEGAN REALIZING THAT SOMETHING WAS DEFINITELY WRONG. I ALERTED MY PAX TO WATCH CLOSELY FOR TFC. UPON ASSESSING MY POS; AN IMMEDIATE TURN AND DES TOWARD THE E WAS MADE TO INSURE SEP FROM ANY TFC. I PROCEEDED ESE UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE ARSA. I LOCATED THE SMYRNA ARPT AND LANDED. CONSIDERING HUMAN PERFORMANCE FACTORS; MY FIRST ERROR WAS NOT MAKING RADIO CONTACT WITH NASHVILLE ARSA UPON HAVING DOUBT AS TO MY EXACT LOCATION. SECONDLY; A NAV ERROR WAS MADE NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHERE I WAS WHILE OPERATING AROUND AN INTENSE AREA SUCH AS THE ARSA. I AM ASHAMED; EMBARRASSED AND RESPONSIBLE FOR MY ACTIONS.

AT THE STEEPEST PART OF THE TURN; WE INDICATED 75 KTS WITH FULL FLAPS. ON THE LEVEL OFF; THE AIRPLANE'S SLUGGISH RESPONSE TO THE GO AROUND AND DESIRED CLB WAS UNEXPECTED AND POSSIBLY DUE TO A WIND SHEAR. WE DESCENDED TO AN ALT APPROX LEVEL WITH THE ARPT BLDGS BEFORE CLBING AGAIN AND CLEARING THEM BY ABOUT 50'. I INADVERTENTLY HAD THE VOLUME TURNED DOWN; AND SINCE HEARING NO ONE ON THE FREQ; I CONTINUED TO BFL.

THE WX WAS IMC WITH MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW; THE TEMP WAS 33 DEGS F. I REQUESTED FOR THE ACFT TO BE DEICED. THE F/O AND MYSELF MADE WALKAROUNDS; EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL EXCEPT THAT SNOW HAD LODGED AROUND THE BRAKE ASSEMBLY OF THE MAIN GEAR AND NOSE WHEEL AREAS. I ADVISED THE LGA OPS THAT I WOULD LIKE THE DEICING CREW TO DEICE THOSE AREAS ALONG WITH THE WHOLE ACFT. WE TAXIED OUT AND SPENT 20 MINS IN GETTING TO THE RWY (13/31). WE WERE #2 FOR DEP; ACR Y; AN MLG; WAS #1. I OBSERVED A LARGE ACCUMULATION OF SNOW ON THE TAIL OF THAT ACFT. AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE F/O OF THE DEADHEADING CREW CAME FORWARD; WITH MY PERMISSION; TO ADVISE ME OF THE SNOW ACCUMULATION ON OUR WINGS. I LOOKED FOR MYSELF AND INSTRUCTED THE F/O TO REQUEST A RETURN TO THE GATE FOR FURTHER DEICING. BACK IN THE GATE I AGAIN ASKED OPS TO HAVE THE DEICING CREW CHK THE WHEEL ASSEMBLIES FOR SNOW PACKING AND TO DEICE. WE DEPARTED THE GATE AGAIN AND PROCEEDED TO RWY 13. AS I ACCELERATED DOWN THE RWY I NOTICED 2 HESITATIONS OF ACCELERATION. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS THE SNOW DISLODGING FROM THE WHEEL AREAS AND THE WHEELS RUNNING OVER SAME. AFTER WE BECAME AIRBORNE THE TWR CTLR ASKED; '(ID); ARE YOU OK?' WE RPTED; 'YES; WE ARE FINE.' THE OPERATION WAS NORMAL AND A LNDG WAS MADE AT MSP. ABOUT 1 1/2 HRS INTO THE FLT THE CAPT OF THE DEADHEADING CREW ASKED PERMISSION TO SPEAK TO ME. I GRANTED HER ENTRANCE INTO THE COCKPIT. SHE INFORMED ME THAT AS I TOOK THE RWY FOR DEP AND PUT ON THE LNDG LIGHTS SHE COULD SEE SNOW COMING OFF THE TRAILING EDGE OF THE WING AND SNOW SLIDING BY THE WINDOWS. SHE ALSO INFORMED ME AT THAT TIME THAT THERE WERE 2 LOUD BANGING SOUNDS NEAR THE ENG AREAS. AT THAT TIME ONE OF THE DEADHEADING F/A'S IN THE CABIN YELLED OUT; 'PREPARE FOR IMPACT.' LATER MY #1 F/A EXPRESSED TO ME SHE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING IN. WE LANDED AT MSP AND I HAD MAINT LOOK OVER THE ENGS AND ALSO NOTIFIED FLT CTL. I CALLED LGA TWR LONG DISTANCE AND TALKED TO THE TWR SUPVR. HE SAID HE OBSERVED 2 BRIGHT FLAMES COMING FROM THE REAR OF OUR 2 ENGS. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED RWY 13 AND CALLED DEP CTL TO SEE IF WE WERE AIRBORNE AND IN RADAR CONTACT. HE SAID HE WAS READY TO ALERT EMER PERSONNEL AND EQUIP IF HE DID NOT GET A POSITIVE RPT FROM DEP CTL. PS: I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A FOLLOW-UP ON MY RPT; PLEASE. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: THE RWY HAD BEEN PLOWED EARLIER BUT IT WAS STILL SNOWING. AT THE TIME OF TKOF THERE WAS A BRIEF LET UP IN THE SNOW FALL AND RWYS 4/22 WERE CLOSED FOR SNOWPLOW OPERATION. THE TKOF RUN WAS CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN NORMAL AND THE DEADHEAD CAPT RPTED HEARING 8-9 COMPRESSOR STALLS. RPTR RESTATED THAT HE NOTED SOME HESITATION DURING TKOF ROLL; BUT THOUGHT IT BECAUSE OF THE SNOW PACK BTWN THE TIRES BEING THROWN AHEAD OF THE ACFT AND CREATING AN OBSTACLE.

I REDUCED THE ELECTRIC LOAD; LEAVING ONLY THE PITOT HEAT AND AVIONICS ON AND CHKED THE LOAD METER. THE LOAD METER APPEARED INOP; SHOWING A ZERO READING ON EVERY SETTING. DOING THE PROC TWICE I WAS CONTINUING TO LOSE ELECTRIC ITEMS. FIRST; THE LEFT ENG ELECTRIC GAUGES QUIT (FUEL QUANTITY AND OIL TEMP). WITHIN A FEW MINS THE RIGHT ENG ELECTRIC GAUGES QUIT. AT THAT TIME; THE APCH CTLR WAS GIVING THE WX AT TERRE HAUTE TO ANOTHER PLANE. CEILING 1700'. AT THIS TIME I WAS ABOVE A CLOUD LAYER IN VFR CONDITIONS. I HAD BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF MY NAV EQUIP'S RELIABILITY SINCE SHORTLY AFTER I CROSSED BMG. IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT. REFERRING TO MY MAP; I FLEW A HDG; MADE A DECISION TO DES AND LAND. I WAS WAITING FOR THE FREQ TO CLR TO CALL THE CTLR WHEN THE RADIOS FELL OFF THE LINE (QUIT MID SENTENCE). I USED MY TRANSPONDER TO SQUAWK THE SEQUENCE CODES AND ATTEMPTED TO CALL ON THE RADIO. REALIZING THIS WAS ALL USELESS; I LOOKED AROUND THE SKY; THEN MADE A WIDE RIGHT TURN TO ATTEMPT TO FIND A HOLE IN THE LAYER BELOW. WHEN THERE WAS NO HOLE; I TURNED TO THE SAME HDG I HAD BEEN ON AND BEGAN MY DES. DURING MY DES I CONTINUED TO ATTEMPT TO GET THE ELECTRIC TO RESPOND. I CHOSE TO STAY ON THAT HDG BECAUSE THE RPTED WX I RECEIVED BEFORE THE FLT CALLED FOR BETTER WX TO THE W OF MY POS. I WAS ABLE TO REMAIN VFR UNTIL I REACHED 3000'. I WENT THROUGH A CLOUD LAYER AND BROKE OUT AT 2000' AND SLOWED MY SPD. I REMAINED BELOW THE CLOUD LAYER AND ON THE SAME HDG UNTIL I REACHED A MAJOR HWY. I TURNED TO THE W AND FOLLOWED THE HWY TOWARD A CITY I BELIEVED LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE AN ARPT. SHORTLY AFTER; I SPOTTED A SMALL STRIP. I LOCATED SOME SMOKE TWRS TO FIND THE WIND DIRECTION. I MADE A PASS OVER THE ARPT; THEN HEADED N AND SLOWED MY SPD FOR THE APCH. I ATTEMPTED TO GET THE ELECTRIC BACK 1 MORE TIME. WITH NO ELECTRIC PWR; I MANUALLY EXTENDED THE GEAR; TURNING THE CRANK UNTIL IT STOPPED. ON FINAL; JUST AS A FINAL ATTEMPT; I PUT THE FLAP HANDLE DOWN; TURNED THE BOOST PUMPS ON; PROP LEVERS FORWARD; AND ADVISED MY PAX TO BRACK THEMSELVES AND BE SURE THEIR RESTRAINTS WERE TIGHT. I ALSO ADVISED THEM THAT THE GEAR WAS DOWN; BUT I HAD NO INDICATION TO KNOW IF IT WAS LOCKED. I WAS ON SHORT FINAL FULLY PREPARED TO DO A GO AROUND IF NECESSARY. THE STRIP HAD HIGH LINES AT THE LNDG END OF THE RWY; SO I KEPT PWR ON THE PLANE UNTIL I WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE OBSTACLE; THEN TAKING ALL OF THE PWR OFF THE PLANE; I DOVE FOR THE END OF THE RWY AND GND EFFECT WHERE I LEVELED OFF AND BEGAN FEELING FOR THE GND. I FELT THE PLANE ROLLING ON THE LEFT MAIN; TURNED AND TOLD MY PAX WE DO HAVE A LNDG GEAR; FELT FOR THE RIGHT WHEEL AND REALIZED IT WAS NOT GOING TO HOLD.

UPON RECEIVING THE INITIAL CLRNC WE THOUGHT MAYBE THE CTLR JUST FORGOT TO GIVE IT TO USE EARLIER.

'ATL DEP; MLG (ABC) WITH YOU; 2000 CLBING TO 10000.' DEP REPLIED; 'ROGER MLG (ABC); TURN LEFT 360 DEGS.' MY F/O ACKNOWLEDGED THE TURN. I IMMEDIATELY TOLD MY F/O THAT THAT WAS A STRANGE TURN FOR US (DEPARTING RWY 9L). AS I STARTED A TURN TO 360 DEGS; I SAW THERE WAS AN LGT ON DEP FROM THE N RWY. THE LGT WAS OFF THE GND; EVEN (ALONG SIDE OF) US BUT MUCH LOWER. I STOPPED OUR TURN AT HDG OF 080 OR 085 DEGS AND TOLD MY F/O OF THE OTHER ACFT AND ASKED HIM TO VERIFY THE TURN WITH DEP.

WE ACKNOWLEDGED AND I ASKED THE F/O TO FLY THE ACFT; THAT I WANTED TO TALK TO DEP. DEP THEN TOLD US THAT WE HAD TAKEN A TURN FOR LGT (BBC). HE THEN MADE SEVERAL OTHER TRANSMISSIONS.

BOTH MY F/O AND I WERE WEARING HEADSETS AND CLEARLY HEARD ALL TRANSMISSIONS.

AT THE REQUEST OF THE CAPT A CONVERSATION FOLLOWED. THE CTLR FELT THAT WE HAD TAKEN A TURN WHICH WAS ORDERED TO FLT LGT (BBC). BOTH THE CAPT AND I HEARD (ABC) AND I READ BACK 'MLG (ABC) LEFT TO 360 DEGS.' LGT (BBC) WAS ON ANOTHER FREQ ACCORDING TO THE DEP CTLR. PERHAPS WHEN I CHKED IN IT SORT OF PROGRAMMED THE DEP CTLR'S MIND TO (ABC) INSTEAD OF (BBC). HE ROGERED OUR CHK-IN AND GAVE THE TURN ALL IN THE SAME TRANSMISSIONS AND UNDER THE SINGLE CALL SIGN; AND HE DIDN'T CATCH HIS ERROR. AFTER MY READBACK FOR THAT MOMENT I BELIEVE HE HAD US CONFUSED WITH LGT (BBC).

I INFORMED THE CAPT OF OUR NEW INSTRUCTIONS. THE CAPT (PNF) INITIATED THE CHANGE OVER REQUEST FOR LNDG DATA AND ALSO BEGAN COPYING THE ATIS INFO.

THE CTLR CALLED JUST AS I FINISHED COPYING ATIS AND INFORMED US WE WERE PAST THE R AND ISSUED A RADAR VECTOR TO SJC. BECAUSE SJC ATIS IS ON THE VOR FREQ I DID NOT HAVE MY NAV AVAILABLE TO ME WHILE COPYING ATIS. I BELIEVE SJC SHOULD USE ANOTHER FREQ FOR ATIS.

HE PREPARED FOR DEP BY SETTING UP THE OUTBOUND FROM CVG AND I (F/O) SET UP THE INBOUND TO DQN. THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS USED SINCE THE DEPARTURE IS RADAR VECTORS AND THIS ALLOWS AN INTERCEPT ANYWHERE ALONG THE ROUTE SEGMENT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DEP WE WERE GIVEN A HEADING TO INTERCEPT COURSE. THE CAPT TURNED TO INTERCEPT; BUT HAD MISTAKENLY DIALED IN V-275W INSTEAD OF V-275. INDIANAPOLIS CENTER ASKED OUR HEADING AND THEN GAVE A VECTOR TO A FIX PAST DQN. THERE WAS NEVER ANY MENTION FROM CENTER THAT A TURN ONTO THE WRONG RADIAL HAD BEEN ATTEMPTED. LEFT TO OUR OWN DEVICES THE MISTAKE WOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY. THE WRONG RADIAL HAD ONLY BEEN FLOWN ABOUT 15 OR 20 SECONDS. THERE WAS A POTENTIAL TRAP DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE CVG OUTBOUND COURSE IS ON US(LO) 28 CHART. THE DQN INBOUND IS ON US(LO) 23. DQN IS NOT ON THE CVG 10-1 CHART. THE CTLR'S TERMINOLOGY WAS POOR. WE WERE CLRED TO INTERCEPT COURSE; NOT TO INTERCEPT V-275. BEING CLRED TO V-275 WOULD HAVE ALERTED THE CAPT. HAVING AIRWAYS WITH THE SAME NUMBER IS OBVIOUSLY CONFUSING. ADDING TO THE CONFUSION IS THE FACT THAT LIKE NUMBERED AIRWAYS ARE VERY UNCOMMON. IN THIS CASE IF THE INBOUND V-275; WHICH I HAD SELECTED IN MY CDI; IS EXTENDED PAST ITS 22 DME LENGTH IT CROSSES V-275W NORTH OF CVG. A TURN UP V-275W APPEARS AS AN INTERCEPT HEADING TO V-275. AFTER THE CAPT TURNED TO INTERCEPT I CROSS CHECKED DME; THE COURSE I HAD SELECTED; AND THEN THE CVG RADIAL. CONSECUTIVELY; THE CENTER GAVE US ANOTHER VECTOR. ALTHOUGH ONLY A FEW SECONDS HAD ELAPSED WE RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL. ANOTHER DIRECT CAUSE WAS THE UNNECESSARY USE OF VICTOR AIRWAYS WITH TURBOJET ACFT. THE CINCINNATI ONE DEP DEPICTS NO ROUTES; ONLY FIXES INCLUDING DQN. FLT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED VIA ONE OF SEVERAL JET ROUTES OR SHORT TIME SPAN IS CUMBERSOME AT BEST. AFTER THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM HAD BEEN DISCOVERED THE CAPT ASKED IF THERE WERE TWO V-275'S. I ANSWERED YES. CAPT IS AN OUTSTANDING CAPT. HE IS THE ABSOLUTE MODEL OF PROFESSIONALISM. HIS NAVIGATION TECHNIQUE IS EXEMPLORY. THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN TO HIM SHOWS IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE. THE TRAP SHOULD BE ELIMINATED FROM THIS DEP.

NO PROVISION WAS MADE BY ATC FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT HELI'S SUCH AS OURS TO MANAGE THE EQUALLY CHAOTIC TFC CONDITIONS ON THE LCL FREEWAYS. DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR DUTIES (TFC MGT AD MOTORCADE ESCORT); IT WAS NECESSARY TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION FROM ATC (MONTGOMERY TWR AND STADIUM CTL) TO DEVIATE FROM PUBLISHED ROUTES & ALTS AROUND THE STADIUM & AND ATA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WHILE ESCORTING A TEAM BUS MOTORCADE TO THE STADIUM; AT THE REQUEST OF SAN DIEGO PD; I WAS OPERATING THE HELI RIGHT ON THE STADIUM PARKING LOT BOUNDARIES. I HAD BEEN CLRD INTO THE AREA BY STADIUM CTL AT 500' AGL. IT COULD HAVE APPEARED TO SOMEONE ON THE GND; DEPENDING ON THEIR LOCATION; THAT I WAS FLYING LOWER THAN 500' OR THAT I WAS OVER THE STADIUM OR PARKING LOT. MY ATTN WAS CONSTANTLY DIVIDED BY THE EXTREMELY HEAVY CONCENTRATION OF AIR TFC AT ALL ALTS IN THE VICINITY OF THE STADIUM.

DURING THE DAY; I AM SURE THAT SEVERAL SLIP-UPS WERE MADE BY PLTS OPERATING IN THE AREA. I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER RELATE THIS STORY TO YOU IN CASE ONE OF THESE SLIP-UPS COULD HAVE BEEN MINE. THE AIRSPACE AROUND THE STADIUM WAS FAR TOO SATURATED TO BE SAFE. PLTS COULD NOT EVEN GET IN ON THE RADIO TO MAKE ALL OF THE NECESSARY CALLS TO ATC. ATC DID NOT CREATE AN ACCIDENT FREE ENVIRONMENT. PLTS SEEING AND AVOIDING DID.

AT THAT TIME HE WAS LEAVING FL188. BY THIS TIME THE HOU DEP RUSH HAD MATERIALIZED AND I WAS VERY BUSY WITH SOME DEPS AND ARRS AT HOU. THIS IS ON THE FAR LEFT SIDE OF MY SCOPE AND THE LTT AND MLG ARE ON THE FAR RIGHT SIDE OF MY SCOPE WHICH IS BEING OPERATED ON THE 150 MI RANGE BECAUSE OF THE SECTOR SIZE. IN ADDITION; I HAD APPROX 15-17 ACFT ON FREQ. WHEN THE MLG CAME OVER HE WAS LEVEL AT FL230 AND I ISSUED HIM FL280 FOR SOME POSSIBLE OPP DIR TFC. THE MLG WAS ABOUT 7 MI TO THE N OF THE LTT; BUT WHAT I DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT THE LOW ALT CTLR HAD ASSIGNED THE LTT A HDG OF 270 BUT DID NOT ASSIGN THE MLG A HDG. THE MLG WAS APPARENTLY FLYING A HDG OF ABOUT 255 DEGS. I EXPECTED THE LTT TO CONTINUE CLBING FAST FOR 2 REASONS: 1) BECAUSE OF THE TYPE ACFT AND 2) BECAUSE HE HAD FILED FOR FL390 FOR A 200 MI TRIP. BUT; THIS WAS NOT THE CASE. THE LTT INSTEAD REDUCED HIS RATE OF CLB TO 600 FPM. THE MLG WAS DOING ABOUT 300 FPM. AS I SAID EARLIER; I WAS VERY BUSY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY SCOPE AND BY THE TIME I LOOKED BACK AND SAW THE SITUATION; ABOUT 1 MIN; THE LTT WAS LEAVING FL266 AND THE MLG WAS LEAVING FL255. I ASSIGNED THE MLG FL260 AND TOLD THE LTT TO EXPEDITE HIS CLB WHICH HE DID NOT DO. THE MLG WENT AS HIGH AS FL262 AT THE TIME THE LTT WAS AT FL268 AND THEY WERE 3.5 MI APART. IT WAS A COMBINATION OF EVENTS THAT CAUSED THIS SITUATION. 1) THE LTT PLT SHOULD HAVE ADVISED ME OF HIS REDUCED RATE OF CLB. 2) THE LOW ALT CTLR SHOULD HAVE ADVISED ME OF THE ASSIGNMENT/NON ASSIGNMENT OF HDGS THAT CAUSED THE TFC TO CONVERGE. 3) BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTED RATE OF CLB; I LET MYSELF BE LULLED INTO THINKING THE SITUATION WOULD NOT BE A PROB AND THEREFORE DIVERTED MY ATTN TO WHAT I FELT WERE GREATER PROBS AT THE TIME.",,,,"CLIMBING GOV-LTT CONVERGED WITH CLIMBING ACR-MLG RESULTING IN LESS THAN STANDARD SEPARATION.",

TO MY BEST KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE 13TH OR 14TH FAILURE OF WINDSHIELDS (CRACKING LIKE WHAT I SAW) WITH THIS COMPANY WHILE FLYING THE MDT ACFT. CONTRIBUTING FACTOR: A POOR DESIGN BY MANUFACTURER. CORRECTIVE ACTION: I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE CHIEF OF AIR CARRIER OPS THAT ALL 'ORIGINAL' WINDSHIELDS HAVE BEEN CHANGED AND 'HOPEFULLY' NO OTHER PROBS WILL OCCUR. OTHER COMMENTS: 1 OTHER CAPT (SENIOR TO ME) WAS SEVERELY CRITICIZED BY THE OWNER OF THIS COMPANY FOR REFUSING TO FLY HIS ACFT WITH A TOTALLY SIMILAR PROB AS MINE. I AGREED TO FERRY MY ACFT TO SALISBURY; MD; ONLY AFTER A SECOND MECH AGREED TO SIGN IT OFF AS STRUCTURALLY SOUND TO FLY AT 180 KTS MAX; PRESS BELOW .25; WINDSHIELD HEAT OFF; NO ICE.

SO WE BOTH HESITATED; HE GAVE ME THE OPTION NOT TO GO BUT IN THE END I TOLD HIM I WOULD BE ALERT ONCE FLYING. I EXPRESSED A LOT OF RESERVATIONS ABOUT FLYING FROM THE BACK SEAT; AS I HAVE MINIMAL EXPENCE IN THAT SEAT; BUT AGAIN GAVE IN; SO HE COULD HAVE A MORE REALISTIC EXPERIENCE IN THE PLANE; FROM THE FRONT SEAT.

THE COPLT EXPLAINED TO ATC THAT HE HAD CLRED US TO FL210 AND CENTER'S REPLY WAS THAT HE WAS EXPLAINING TO US THAT HE WAS HOLDING US AT FL200 DUE TO TFC AT FL210.

ALSO; WHEN WE GOT WHAT WE UNDERSTOOD TO BE OUR CLRNC TO FL210 A PAX WAS ASKING US A QUESTION. THE CENTER WAS EXTREMELY BUSY WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATION. PREVENTING A RECURRENCE: ONE OF THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF ANY CREW IS TO MANAGE COCKPIT DISTRS; NO MATTER WHAT THE DISTR MAY BE. IT HAS BEEN OUR FLT DEPT'S POLICY TO CONFIRM ALL QUESTIONABLE CLRNCS WITH ATC AND BTWN CREW MEMBERS. EVEN THOUGH WE DID NOT CONSIDER THE CLRNC QUESTIONABLE AT THE TIME; IT IS EVIDENT WE MISSED PART OF ATC'S MESSAGE. I ALSO BELIEVE ATC SHOULD REFRAIN FROM USING NONPERTINENT ALTS WHEN RELAYING MESSAGES TO CREWS; PARTICULARLY WHEN THE FREQ IS BUSY. (EG; 'LEVEL-OFF AT FL200 DUE TO TFC ABOVE;' INSTEAD OF 'LEVEL-OFF AT FL200 DUE TO FL210 TFC.') WHY WE DIDN'T RECEIVE A CORRECTION FROM CENTER ON OUR CLRNC READBACK I STILL DON'T KNOW. TO BE SURE; I'LL BE LISTENING TO CENTER INTENTLY AND DOING MY BEST TO IGNORE COCKPIT DISTRS IN THE FUTURE. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION FROM ACN 81387: THE FREQ WAS EXTREMELY CONGESTED WITH FREQUENT BREAKS IN TRANSMISSIONS AS SOMEONE WOULD CUT IN.

AT RWY 18L ON TWR FREQ 124.15 SMT X WAS #3 ACFT ON TXWY 18; #1 BEING SMT Y; SMT Z #2. ALL 3 TURBO PROPS WERE CLRD ACROSS RWY 18L AND ASSIGNED RWY 18R FOR DEP. UPON REACHING RWY 18R SMT X WAS INSTRUCTED TO TRANSITION TO TXWY 19 AND TO HOLD SHORT OF RWY 18R AT 19. WE PROCEEDED AS INSTRUCTED. SEQUENCE FOR DEP WAS ANNOUNCED AS SMT Y; SMT X AND SMT Z.

SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE CTLR'S CLRNC I IMMEDIATELY INITIATED A 180 DEG TURN OFF THE TXWY AND ADVISED THE CTLR OF THE SITUATION. THE CTLR HAD NO IDEA WHICH ACFT WAS #1; NOR WHERE WE WERE. HOWEVER; HE WOULD NOT ALLOW ENOUGH TIME ON THE FREQ FOR ANYONE ELSE TO SPEAK AND EVEN CLRD SMT Y FOR TKOF A SECOND TIME; EVEN AS WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION.

SHORTLY THEREAFTER; A WDB WAS TOLD TO GO AROUND WHEN OVER THE THRESHOLD DUE TO TFC ON THE RWY WHEN THE RWY WAS ACTUALLY CLR. ALL IN ALL WE DID NOT DEPART UNTIL 40 MINS AFTER WE LEFT OUR GATE; AND WE WERE THE LAST OF THE TURBO PROPS TO DEPART. I ASSUMED WE WERE BEING PENALIZED FOR THE INCOMPETENCY AND INEPTNESS OF THE CTLR. NEVER DID THE OJT INSTR EVEN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT ANY SITUATION ON THE FREQ AND ALL THE WHILE SEVERAL JET ACFT WHICH HAD LEFT THEIR GATES LONG AFTER WE DID WERE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE DEPARTING ON RWY 18L.

WE WERE NEVER TOLD BY THE CTLR THAT THERE WAS A RWY CHANGE (LESS THAN 20 MINS AFTER ATIS INFO X-RAY). STL APCH IS FAMOUS (OR INFAMOUS) FOR CHANGING YOUR RWY AT THE LAST MINUTE IN IFR/IMC CONDITIONS. MOST AIRLINES (INCLUDING OURS) REQUIRES THAT IFR APCHES BE REVIEWED AND BRIEFED. CONDITIONS AT STL PRECLUDE ORDERLY APCHES AND IMPAIR SAFETY. STL APCH NEEDS TO REVAMP THEIR PROCS TO ENSURE THAT CREWS HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO PREPARE FOR AN APCH IN IMC CONDITIONS. EVEN THE FREQUENT CHANGES FROM 30R TO 30L TO 30R WITHIN 12 MI OF THE ARPT ARE UNSATISFACTORY. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: IN THIS RPTR'S VIEW; CHANGING RWYS AT THE LAST MINUTE IS A COMMON PRACTICE AT STL. THERE CHANGES ARE NOT ALWAYS FROM RWY 30 TO 12; OR 12 TO 30; BUT MOST OFTEN A CHANGE FROM 30R TO 30L AND THEN BACK TO 30R.

I WAS CONDUCTING A PLT CHK FLT WITH A PVT PLT WISHING TO HAVE RENTAL PRIVILEGES AT THE FBO/FLT SCHOOL WHERE I AM A PART TIME CFI. I CAN ONLY ASSUME I WAS INVOLVED IN A MIDAIR NEAR MISS BECAUSE I NEVER HAD THE OTHER ACFT IN SIGHT. BUT; I ASSUME IT DID HAPPEN BASED ON THE STATEMENT OF THE PLT OF THE OTHER ACFT. WHILE TAXIING TO THE ACTIVE RWY I ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM WITH THE PLYMOUTH UNICOM THAT THE ACFT RADIO WAS OPERATING PROPERLY. I NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM THEM TO MY REQUEST FOR A RADIO CHK. I ASSUMED THE ACFT RADIO WAS NOT TRANSMITTING BUT DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE FLT SINCE USE OF A RADIO IS NOT REQUIRED AT UNCTLED ARPTS. TO HELP PLTS SEE US BETTER; I TURNED ON THE ACFT'S NAV; STROBE AND LNDG LIGHTS AND LEFT THEM ON THROUGHOUT THE FLT. ALSO; I DID BROADCAST MY POS ANYWAY WHILE OPERATING IN THE TFC PATTERN. DURING THE THIRD LNDG WE TURNED; AND AFTER BEING ESTABLISHED ON A BASE LEG I HEARD THE PLT OF AN SMA Y BROADCAST HE WAS ALSO ON BASE. I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR HIM. ONCE MY ACFT WAS ON FINAL; A FEW SECS LATER; I HEARD HIM BROADCAST THAT HE WAS GOING AROUND. AT THIS POINT I STILL DID NOT SEE SMA Y AND PROCEEDED WITH THE LNDG. ONCE ON THE RAMP AND AFTER HE SHUT DOWN; HE CAME OVER TO ME AND EXPLAINED HOW CLOSE WE HAD COME. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I SHOT OUT FROM UNDER HIM. SINCE WE WERE BOTH FLYING LOW WINGED ACFT; I CAN ONLY COME UP WITH ONE EXPLANATION. IF I WAS UNDER AND BEHIND HIM; I WOULD HAVE HAD TO SEE HIM. MY EXPLANATION IS THAT WE WERE ALREADY ON FINAL AND PROCEEDING TOWARD THE RWY AT ABOUT 70 KTS; THE FINAL APCH SPD OF SMA Y IS 63 KTS. THE SMA X WITH AN APCH SPD RECOMMENDED BY ACFT MFTR IS 75 KTS; WAS TURNING BASE TO FINAL. OUR SPD TOWARD THE RWY WOULD CERTAINLY SEEM LIKE WE OVERTOOK THE ACFT; BUT AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. FORTUNATELY NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED. SINCE MY ACFT WAS UNDER THE SMA Y AND ON FINAL WE HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY. THE PLT OF THE SMA Y RPTED A NMAC RPT WITH THE NE FSDO OFFICE. SINCE I WAS IN THE RIGHT SEAT; THE BASE TO FINAL TURN WOULD HAVE POSITIONED THE ROOF OF THE SMA X TO BLOCK ANY TFC ABOVE US. OUR APCH SPDS WERE APPROX 70 KTS OR LOWER; SINCE I INSIST ON THIS WITH STUDENTS AND WAS PAYING PARTICULAR ATTN TO HOW THE PVT PLT I WAS CHKING WAS HANDLING THE ACFT.

WHILE CLBING OUT WE WERE ADVISED OF TFC IN OUR 1 O'CLOCK POS. WE (MY STUDENT; ACTUALLY) ACKNOWLEDGED THE TFC. APPROX 5 MI NE OF OAK OUR INTERCOM CEASED TO FUNCTION.

I CHANGED FREQS; TURNED THE RADIO OFF; CHKED THE AMMETER; CHKED MY PUSH-TO-TALK BUTTON; CHKED THE HAND-HELD MIC BUTTON AND THOUGHT I OBSERVED MY STUDENT MANIPULATING HIS PUSH-TO-TALK BUTTON. I DID NOT CHK THE CB'S; AS THE RADIO FREQ DISPLAY STILL SHOWED UP AND WE COULD RECEIVE THE NAV SIDE OF THE NAV COM. WE KNEW THEN THAT OUR CABIN SPEAKER AND HEADSETS WERE BOTH FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.

I REALIZED AT THAT POINT THAT I HAD NOT MYSELF CHKED MY STUDENT'S PUSH-TO-TALK BUTTON NOR HAD I INSTRUCTED HIM TO CHK IT. HOWEVER; WHEN WE RECHKED IT AFTERWARDS IT WAS NOT STUCK; PERHAPS FROM MY UNGRACEFUL LNDG.

SECONDLY; AN EMER SITUATION OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER ACFT THAT DISTRACTED BOTH ATC AND ACFT; PREVENTING ACFT FROM OBTAINING NECESSARY ATC INFO.

IN THE FUTURE; THIS SITUATION WILL BE DILIGENTLY AVOIDED BY: INCREASED AWARENESS/STUDY OF SECTIONAL CHART; INCREASED PILOTAGE SKILLS; PRE-PROGRAMMING OF LORAN C ON GND AND STUDIOUS AVOIDANCE OF RESTR AIRSPACE UNLESS CLRED BY ATC. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: FLT CREW THOUGHT THEY WERE CLR OF AREA AND WERE NAVING BY LORAN C; AND ALSO THOUGHT SINCE EDW HAD ANSWERED THEM AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT COURSE THEY WERE NAVING OK. THEN; WHEN EDW INTERRUPTED BY EMER THEY WERE DISTRACTED LISTENING TO COM ON THAT AND WERE NOT WATCHING MAPS CLOSELY ENOUGH. THEY WERE JUST IN THE EDGE OF AREA AND QUICKLY VECTORED OUT.

I ASKED COMPANY TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTUAL TERRAIN AT THE POINT OF OUR GPWS WARNING. I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE THE ALTIMETER SETTING; BUT I TURNED IN PAPERWORK AND FORGOT IT. IF I GET FURTHER INFO THAT WOULD INTEREST YOU (ACTUAL TERRAIN CONFLICT); I WILL SEND ANOTHER RPT. CALLBACK CONVERSATION WITH RPTR REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE IN THIS LOCATION. A FOREIGN CARRIER HAS CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH. THERE IS A 5637' HILL IN THE AREA THAT SHOWS ON THE DEP CHART; BUT IT IS NOT DEPICTED ON THE APCH CHART. THE CHART PUBLISHER HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD INCLUDE THIS HILL ON FURTHER APCH CHARTS.

ONLY ONCE WAS I ALLOWED TO GO AS HIGH AS 3500'; BUT THIS WAS S OF MEIGS. THE SOLUTION IS EASY: BRING THE SINGLE ENG IFR ROUTE CLOSE TO SHORE/RAISE THE ALT SO WE ARE WITHIN GLIDING DISTANCE OF LAND.

APCHING FOR A LNDG EVERYTHING WAS ROUTINE EXCEPT FOR SOME GUSTY SURFACE WINDS. AS I FLARED FOR THE T/D; I COULD FEEL THE WHEELS EVER-SO-GENTLY KISS THE RWY--MY BEST LNDG OF THE MONTH--BUT AT THAT MOMENT (AND BEFORE THE AUTOMATIC SPOILERS COULD DEPLOY) A GUST CAUGHT US AND WE FLOATED 10-15' BACK INTO THE AIR. THE CAPT; THINKING WE WERE STILL ON THE GND AND THAT THE AUTO FUNCTION OF THE SPOILERS HAD FAILED; SUDDENLY REACHED OUT TO MANUALLY DEPLOY THEM. I SAW HIM DO THIS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE; BUT MY SCREAM OF 'NOT THE SPOILERS!!' WAS TOO LATE. AT THAT POINT; WITH THE ENGS AT IDLE; THE ONLY THING I HAD TIME TO DO WAS PULL THE YOKE BACK INTO MY LAP AND WATCH MY LIFE/JOB FLASH BEFORE MY EYES. IT WAS THE MOST HELPLESS FEELING I'VE EVER HAD IN MY 20 YRS OF FLYING EXPERIENCE AS WE QUITE ABRUPTLY RE-ENGAGED THE RWY. AMAZINGLY THE ONLY DAMAGE DONE WAS TO THE PAX CONFIDENCE IN THEIR PLTS. THE OCCURRENCE OF NONDEPLOYMENT OF AUTOSPOILERS IS NOT THAT UNCOMMON ON THE MLG. BUT; THE STANDARD PRACTICE IN THAT CASE IS FOR THE PF TO DEPLOY THEM MANUALLY OR TO CALL 'SPOILERS' FOR THE OTHER PLT TO DO IT. THIS WAS JUST A CASE OF THE CAPT WANTING TO HELP OUT W/O THE PROPER COM. UNLESS REQUESTED OR IN AN EMER; PRIMARY CTLS SHOULD ONLY BE OPERATED BY THE PRIMARY PLT.

IF HE HAD TRIED TO CHK OUR TKOF WT AS OK PRIOR TO TKOF WE WOULD HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THE MANUALS WERE NOT ON THE ACFT AND TAXIED BACK IN TO GET THEM.
